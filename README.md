The marathon, a 26.2-mile race that is enjoyed by runners and spectators across the globe. The sport is wildly popular and hyper competitive. Most of the attention it receives tends to center around records and the athletes who break them. As an avid marathoner, myself and others understand the amount of training required to prepare for a single race. Furthermore, we understand there are variables that can affect our performance. There variables we can train in preparation for, such as altitude or overall difficulty of a course. However, there are some variables that occur on race day which we have no control over. One of these is the weather. While there are general weather trends in certain locations, there is still a lot of variation that can occur. The question is, just how much can that variation impact a runnerâ€™s performance? To try and uncover the causal relationship between the two, I am proposing a multi-way fixed effects model to control for variation in runners, races, and time. The dataset is composed of data scraped from MarathonGuide (an online marathon database accredited by the BAA that consists of marathon results dating back to 2000, for races in English speaking parts of the world) and historical weather data gathered from a weather API called Visual Crossing.
